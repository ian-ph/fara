# Fara

## Why make this project
As a common trend, recruiters highly favors developers who has an active Github repository, they expect you to be a package maker/maintainer, a developer who devote their free time on contributing to open source projects, a developer who copy projects just to make their profile look active, or a developer who will show a privately owned repository disregarding any NDA.

As a developer who is always on-demand, all projects related to my experience are privately owned by my (previous) employers which I cannot simply show to anyone.  And in return, it makes my Github profile empty and make me look rather incompetent to the eyes of those recruiters. While I would rather spend my free time with my family, I started this project to appease those kinds of recruiters.
